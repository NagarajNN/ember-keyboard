## Overview

`ember-keyboard` is a KeyboardEvent manager for Ember.js. It provides a simple API for responding to key events based on the keyboard combos such as `shift+ctrl+s` and `ctrl+Slash` and allows you to declare these behaviors wherever it is most convenient, including via a handy `on-key` template helper and modifier.

For more complex scenarios, `ember-keyboard` also offers an API for managing which components and routes respond to key events, allowing you to control for application states such as modals and loading screens.
