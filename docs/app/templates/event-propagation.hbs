## Event propagation (6.x and up)

Below is an interactive demo of `ember-keyboard`'s event propagation system.
It allows you to see how devent propagation semantics work.
Simply click the containing box and try using the below key commands.

Controls:

* `LeftArrow`: decrement counter by 1
* `RightArrow`: increment counter by 1
* `shift`+ArrowKey: increment/decrement x10
* `ctrl+shift`+ArrowKey: increment/decrement x100
* `r`: resets counter to 0
